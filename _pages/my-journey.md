<!-- TODO:Add the main points of the courses -->

Welcome once again, kindly follow me on a brief trip where I highlight some resources that helped me become a Data Scientist having graduated with Bachelor of Pharamcy.

I have wanted to write codes when in my early undergraduate days, but the load of my undergraduate coursework couldn't allow me finish up well to the level I wanted, I had to ditch writing codes at a time. However, as things will pan out, after my undergraduate studies, I got exposed to MOOCs, which I believe is the best thing that has ever happened to humanity - the ability to learn anything from anywhere.

Here are the list of Resources (MOOCs and books) that helped me land my first Internship as a Data Scientist without Computer Science Degree background:


### Courses:

* Popular Andrew Ng Introductory to Machine Learning Course
* Stanford Database
* Stanford Algorithms and Data Structure
* Coursera
* Geoffery Hinton Course
* Stanford CS231n
* Stanford CS224NLP
* Fast.ai
* MIT Linear Algebra
* Edx Microsoft Data Science Track
* Edx Spark Course
* Coursera Bayesian Network
* IBM Introduction to Data Science
* Stephen Boyd Optimization 
* CS20si


## Books:
Here are the books I found to be most useful in helping me solidify my Data Science and Deep Learning Expertise.

### Data Science and Machine Learning
